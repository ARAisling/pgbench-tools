pgbench-tools Setup
===================

-Create databases for your test and for the results
--Both databases can be the same, but there may be more shared_buffers
  cache churn in that case.  Some amount of cache disruption
  is unavoidable unless the result database is remote, because
  of the OS cache.

-Initialize the results database by executing

  psql -f init/resultdb.sql

Running tests
=============

-Edit the config file to run the tests you want

-Execute

  ./runset

 In order to execute all the tests

Results
=======

-You can check results even as the test is running with:

  psql [resultdb] -f report.sql

-Other useful reports you can run include:
   * summary.sql
   * bufreport.sql
   * bufsummary.sql
 
-Once the tests are done, the results/ directory will include
 a HTML subdirectory for each test giving its results,
 in addition to the summary information in the results database.

-The results directory will also include its own index file that
 shows summary information and plots for all the tests.

-If you manually adjust the test result database, you can
 manually regenerate the summary graphs by running:

  ./webreport

Known issues
============

-If running tests against non-pgbench tables, the database scale
 will not be detected correctly yet

-Recent PostgreSQL 8.4 development releases have changed the
 names of all the pgbench tables such that this program doesn't
 work against recent code snapshots yet

-On Solaris, where the benchwarmer script calls tail it may need
 to use /usr/xpg4/bin/tail instead
